== My notes
Rather than RestTemplate
NOTE: As of 5.0 this class is in maintenance mode, with only minor requests for changes and bugs to be accepted going forward. Please, consider using the org.springframework.web.reactive.client.WebClient which has a more modern API and supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios.

== Project for Lucidworks interview

Hello Matt,

Thank you so much for your patience! As discussed, the next step involves completing a coding project to give Lucidworks a sense for your development aptitude and process. Once complete we will schedule a time for a code review and walk through with members of the team.

== Prompt:

Create a publicly-viewable Github (or similar) repository containing your solution to the problem below.  Please spend no more than 3 hours on your submission. 

== Problem Statement
Create a Customer API that would help to power an online paper store (Dunder Mifflin Paper Company).  Your API should be able to Create, View, List, and Delete customers.  APIs should be written using Spring, and customer information should be persisted in Solr 8.6.3.

Once completed, answer the following question in ‘ANSWER.txt’ in your repository: “If you were building a similar API to serve millions of customers, how would you build it differently?”

== Things To Pay Attention To:
To best reflect how you regularly work, this should be treated with the care you give your work normally.  This includes attention to non-functional concerns such as quality, readability, etc.

Be prepared to answer questions about your submission, making special note of:
Any assumptions you made, and how you came to them
Your code structure
The problems you solve in your code
How your code handles complexity

== Things To Ignore
In an effort to focus on the submitted Java code, reviewers will steer clear of reviewing any build system, packaging, containerization, or other concerns.  To this end a template project has been created here which contains a bootstrapped Spring app and can be used as a base.

== Once complete, 
please send your link to me and provide availability for a 45min Zoom call.
