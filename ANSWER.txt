Once completed, answer the following question in ‘ANSWER.txt’ in your repository: 
“If you were building a similar API to serve millions of customers, how would you build it differently?”

-  Create a proxy service to proxy request to many servers
-  I tested with a standalone Solr server, would have SolrCloud instance backing this Customer api service
-  On that note, this API would be modified to utilize the router_id Solr parameter, 
    which will cause SolrCloud to route docs with a similar hash for a specified field to the same shard.  
    Specified at index time.  Goal to improve query performance.
-  Would add better logging and Unit and Sytem tests.  Mockito?  Python Scripts
-  Add security, especially on delete calls
-  Possibly have an api to look up existing Customers by common fields, name, addres,... Prior to adding a new customer.
-  Provide Facet and Sort options to allow for better presentation of returned data.
